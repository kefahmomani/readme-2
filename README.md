# What is Github?

### GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a    software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code file.


# GitHub Isn’t Just for Developers

### All this talk about how GitHub is ideal for programmers may have you believing that they are the only ones who will find it useful. Although it’s a lot less common, you can actually use GitHub for any types of files. If you have a team that is constantly making changes to a word document, for example,  you could use GitHub as your version control system. This practice isn’t common, since there are better alternatives in most cases, but it’s something to keep in mind.

  Git work with diffrent operating system like:

•	Mac OS X
•	Windows
•	Linux
	
 # How to use GitHub: Operations

## Commit Command:

### This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. When you commit a file,    you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. Though this message is not compulsory but it is always recommended so that it can differentiate the various versions or commits you have done so far to your repository. These commit messages maintain the history of changes which in turn help other contributors to understand the file better. Now let’s make our first commit, follow the below steps:
 
####      Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.
 ###     	Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
 ###     	Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.  
 ###     	Write a commit message which identifies your changes.
 ###     	Click commit changes in the end.
